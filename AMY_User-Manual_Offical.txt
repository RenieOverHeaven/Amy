# **BACKEND FUNCTION**

1. **Multi Attack 1/2/3/4** :
* Enables continuous attacks that persist even when switching characters or scenes.
* Be mindful of potential performance concerns during prolonged use.


2. **Multi Attack -1/-2 (Improved Multi-Attack)**  :
* Enhances the multi-attack functionality by automatically pausing the attack at regular intervals.
* This helps prevent unintended crashes and ensures optimal performance.
* Explore various combinations of attack rotation and versions to find the best fit for your needs.


3. **multix attack**:
* Primarily utilized for conquering the Abyss and defeating bosses.
* Enables multiple attacks for all characters, granting increased offensive power.
* Activation requires remaining stationary, and can be disabled by switching character.


*Notes from author:*

Multiple attack modes 1, 2, 3, and 4 each possess unique
characteristics.

These features include varying levels of attack stacking, duration, and stacking capabilities.

Some modes specialize in skill stacking, while others prioritize ultimate stacking.

Users are free to choose the mode best suited to their needs and preferences.

However, excessive use of any multi-attack mode may lead to game instability and potential crashes.


4. **Speak Speed** :
* This feature allows you to customize the playback speed of in-game dialogues.
* But note the following potential side effects:

***
> *Visual Glitches: At excessively high or low speeds, certain scenes may display a temporary grey screen that becomes unresponsive to touch input. This can be resolved by restarting the game*
> *Button Discrepancy: At high speeds, the dialogue button may visually disappear while remaining functional for interaction.* 
> *Character Model Issues: Rapid dialogue advancement may lead to character models temporarily freezing or displaying inconsistencies.* 
> *For optimal performance and visual fidelity, it is recommended to adjust the dialogue speed within a moderate range and be mindful of potential discrepancies at extreme settings.*

5. **Mob Vaccum :**
* *This powerful feature effectively gathers nearby enemies towards your character.*
* *This is a single-use function that provides its effect for a limited duration. Once the duration ends, the function deactivates and needs to be manually activated again, especially during combat situations.*

* The time interval for function activation can be adjusted in the config settings.

> If the user wants to name it, they can turn on the display ID in the drawing configuration and point to the material. Record the ID manually or copy the ID and send it to the relevant person.


17. Interact - Any interactable object


## Configuration:

* **Quantity color**: Changes the quantity number color icon on top of the screen to the user's desired
    color.

* **Anti-aliasing**: Makes text smoother when drawing objects.
> Drawing range can also be changed to the desired distance (default: infinite).


> Note:Selecting an object category will draw a line to the nearest object of that type, displaying its name and the distance from your character's position.


## Changing Category Color:

Users can change the category color to their desired color by simply long-pressing the category and selecting the desired color.

## Draw Separately:

1. Point the crosshair to the item the user wants to exclude.
2. Tap on Select Materials/Draw Separately \[On/Off] icon in the floating menu.
3. After selecting the object, the user needs to press and hold the button to draw it individually.


## Teleport to Drawn Object (Sponsor Only):

This feature is exclusive to sponsors, allowing users to directly teleport to drawn objects.

### How to Use TDO:

With sponsor privilege, Draw Object has three more options in CONFIG settings that allow users to teleport:
1. **Teleport Center Drawn Object/Change Mode:**
* Enables Teleport mode. Mark the Crosshair on the drawn object and tap on the teleport icon.

# ABILITY REPLACEMENT :

This function lets you assign desired abilities and stats to your character and party by selecting your preferred ability/stat in the designated ability slot.

* **note -**
1. selecting an ability or stat will replace the ability or mechanism prompted in the selected ability slot.
> for example - selecting a new ability in buoyancy mushroom slot will disable the bouncing
> mechanism of mushroom and the Replaced ability will be needed to removed again from the slot in order to enable bouncing mechanism of mushroom again.



2. Stats cannot exceed their upper limit caps, e.g., the critical damage upper limit is 470%. Selecting more than 470% in the ability replacement slot will not surpass the cap (e.g., critdmg 80% + critdmg 120% + critdmg 140% + critdmg 80% + 100% character base crit damage = 520%). The Crit Dmg stat will not surpass 470%.
3. Choosing the same stat in multiple ability slots won't accumulate that stat.
> \- For example, selecting crit rate 20% in different slots will not increase the crit rate stat beyond 20%. 
> \- To stack the stat, use different percentage values of the same stat. For instance, combining crit rate 20% + crit rate 70% + crit rate 100% in different ability slots will grant your character a total crit rate bonus of 190%.


4. abilty slots with **(online exception)**  cannot be used in co-op as they will not function in co-op world.

slots like **Four-colour team, same-color team** and other party related slots will require you to have an active party accordingly to abilty slot for replaced ability to work.

# TRACKING TRANSIENT: TASK TRACKING TELEPORTATION

* Functional Purpose : Teleporting to Task Points
* While **DRAW OBJECT FUNCTION** also facilitates task teleportation, but draw teleport is a VIP function. Some task points lack drawing points, preventing teleportation via drawing.
## Usage Guide:

1. Activate the function
2. Open the quest list or map, choose the quest for teleportation, and click 'Track.'
3. Prior to teleportation, tracking the task is essential.
4. For tasks with automatic tracking, click on the task before teleporting.
5. Teleportation is possible only for distant tasks or commissions.
6. Teleportation won't work if a quest has 2 or more task points.
7. If the character switches scenes during a quest, this function must be reactivated again.

# Set Point
The Set Point function allows user to spawn or teleport to any desired location within the game.

## Sliding Options:
1. **Move North:**  Users can utilize this slider to move in the north direction.
2. **Move Up:**  This slider allows users to ascend or increase height if they wish to spawn at an elevated location, such as in mid-air or on a mountain.
3. **Move West:**  Users can utilize this slider to move in the west direction.


> **Note:**  Users can use all three movement sliders simultaneously, but caution should be exercised to ensure that coordinates are not set too high, as it may cause glitches or even crashes in Genshin Impact.


## Config


### Teleport Mode:

1. **Go Through**: This mode allows the character to teleport passing through terrain and other obstacles. It's the fastest teleport mode but can cause bugs like render delay and characters falling underground.
2. **Divide Segment**: In this mode, the character teleports while hovering mid-air. It's a slower teleport mode but more stable than the Go Through mode.


### Direct Teleportation Height Strategy (For Go Through Mode):

1. **No Processing**: he character will teleport directly according to the set distance.
2. **Fixed Height**: The character will have a fixed preset height before teleporting to the set height. This is added in case there is a rendering issue.



### Segmented Teleportation Height Strategy:

1. **Segment Calculation**: The character will teleport according to the set height in segmented teleport mode.
2. **Fixed Height**: The character will have a fixed height before teleporting to the set height. Note that since segmented teleportation already uses a preset fixed height, both strategies are the same for this mode.


### Number of Coordinate Modifications :

This function is synced to the GET POSITION function. The user can set the coordinate mapping limit.


***
# OBJECT REPLACEMENT
